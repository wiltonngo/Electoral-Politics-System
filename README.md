# Electoral-Politics-System
 You work in the field of electoral politics, and you are specifically interested in ballot measures, where citizens vote directly to enact new laws. You are a GIS analyst for a nongovernmental organization that either supported or opposed (your choice) California’s 2012 ballot measure that would have required labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food. Your task is to look at the broad voting patterns in California on this issue, knowing that the initiative did not gain enough votes to pass.
 
 The precinct level voting data has attributes for who voted in favor of the measure, as well as the total number of voters. Because we are interested in a normalized map, showing percentage of voters rather than total number of voters, you will need to aggregate both of these attributes to the counties, the most likely tool being a spatial join , then create a normalized map of the voting data in order to better assess the geography of the issue. You will also put the total number of people who voted in the election on your map (see the lecture on “Using Feature Classes and Attribute Tables”).
 
 This is what the data that you need.
 
 Counties: The feature data for California counties

PrecinctVotingData: Feature data for California precincts for the 2012 election. Has two relevant attributes:

 a. total_votes: a field containing the total number of individuals who voted in the precinct

  b.	proposition_37_yes_votes: a field containing the number of individuals that voted for the measure in the precinct

You Calculate the Percentage of the People who voted Yes for the Cause/ How many voters


## Findings

Our finding has been dived by five cateogries where people voted Yes. Plus the Country names of the Country
